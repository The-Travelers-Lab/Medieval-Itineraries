# Medieval-Itineraries
A collection of late-medieval itineraries - Bishops, Kings, Travelers

This project is part of the work of the "Travelers Lab" - a medieval history research 
group based at Wesleyan University.

NOTE: Currently the system of itineraries and gazetteers is based on lists of tabular
data (csv's) with pieces of code to move between them.  Eventually, large portions of
the data will be modified to function as a relational database, but currently, for
ease of use in instructional settings, we are maintaining the various pieces of data
as independent csv's that can be accessed easily by students for visualization, 
research, and other projects.

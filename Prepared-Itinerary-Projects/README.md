# Project Description

Below is a list of the sub-projects involved in the Medieval Itineraries
Projects.  The Completed Projects have had their data checked at least twice
and all data known has been entered.  The information can be used for 
visualizations, data experiments, or academic reference purposes.

For the Projects in Process, some or all of the data has not been entered, 
checked, or added to the Gazetteer.  In the README for that project there  
is a To-Do list with the state of the project and where work can best be
accomplished to move the project forward.  If a Project has not been started,
the "Tool-Box" folder contains instructions for how to begin compiling the 
itinerary from either primary or secondary sources.  The Itinerary folder
itself should contain bibliography or references necessary to start the 
project as well as contact information for the proposer of the project.

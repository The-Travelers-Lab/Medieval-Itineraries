# Initial Note:

If you would like to work on any of these items, please contact either Adam
Franklin-Lyons (adamfl@marlboro.edu) or Gary Shaw (gshaw@wesleyan.edu) for 
more detailed instructions.  If you are working on an Itinerary and have produced
new locations that can be added to the full Gazetteer, either branch the existing 
gazetteer or, alternately, upload your csv files to the "New Gazetteer Data" folder 
for re-checking prior to addition to the full dataset.  For instructions on 
accessing the Gazetteer for work on a new itinerary, see the README instructions 
in the Itinerary-Project-Code folder (or contact one of us with questions.)

# To Do List:

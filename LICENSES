#  Notes on the Data

The data compiled in the itineraries folder comes from a combination of new 
research, published works by other scholars, and compilations of data from 
published collections.  Each project in the ITINERARY DATA folder will be 
accompanied by a README file that explains the relevant bibliography and 
references for that particular project.  Where the data has been compiled from a
variety of sources the attribution should be to the Travelers Lab itself.  When 
the majority of the data in an itinerary comes from a published source, the reference
will be clearly posted in the README file and all future use of that data should refer
back to the original publication.  The Gazetteers were compiled by groups of
students and faculty in numerous courses.  As such, all gazetteer information
is available under a *** license.  The data may be freely downloaded and used, 
but any publication or public use of the data should attribute the work of
the Travelers Lab in an appropriate bibliographic format.
